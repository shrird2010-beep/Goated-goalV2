# 🐐 Shrihan's Goated-Goal — An Adjustable Training Soccer Goal that can be used whenever!

## Overview
**Goated Goal** is a fully adjustable soccer training goal designed for individual and team practices. The goal expands up to **10 ft wide and 7 ft tall**, making it significantly bigger and more versatile than most affordable consumer goals. Unlike fixed-sized and overpriced alternatives, Goated Goal can be **changed to different widths** to match training needs and field space. For me, it offers a accurate size goal that I can use for game-like plays.

This project focuses on **mechanical engineering skills, CADing (if thats a word), and prototyping**. Instead of firmware or electronics, the innovation is in its **adjustable design and versitile functionality**, using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf materials.

## Problem with other real-world goals
Most affordable soccer goals are:
- Too small for a realistic shooting practice
- Fixed in size and difficult to adapt (Especially through my basement door!)
- Flimsy or overpriced for their weak build quality

As a student athlete, I wanted a **full-size training goal** that is:
- Adjustable
- Strong enough to handle hard shots
- Portable and easy to assemble
- Affordable (under $100)

My Goated Goal was designed to solve this problem using thoughtful mechanical engineering design.

## Key Features
- Adjustable width up to **10 ft**
- Custom **3D-printed structural corners**
- Telescoping poles for adjustable sizing
- Impact-resistant full-size net
- Hardware-only engineering focus so it is easy for anyone to replicate

## Engineering & Design

### 3D-Printed Corners
The most critical components of the design are the **custom corner brackets**, which connect the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal poles. This really helped me understand cading more.

The right corner features one oversized hole to fit the end of a telescoping pole with an end that has a larger diameter. This ensures a tight fit so it can withstand any shots that I give it.

The left corner was designed with precise diagonal pole measurements to prevent any collapsing.

This is a new addition that I created after I found some old tent poles in my garage. This will cut down my costs and help me create a stronger goal.

## Structural Stability

The diagonal support poles redirect impact forces from the crossbar into the vertical posts. Or in other words, if i hit the goal too hard, the structure will be A-okay.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Football Replacement Goal Net (12×6 ft) | $5.64 |
| 2pcs Heavy-Duty Adjustable Telescopic Support Bar| $20.95 |
| Telescopic Pool Poles (10 ft) | $11.59 |
| Hook & Loop Straps + Buckles (self-funded) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$38.18 (~$39)** |

All materials were selected based on availability, strength, adjustability, and cost efficiency. This took me too long to budget.

## Assembly Summary
1. Insert telescoping poles into the 3D-printed corner brackets
2. Attach diagonal support poles to prevent collapse
3. Extend poles to desired width
4. Secure the net using hook-and-loop straps
5. Adjust sizing based on training needs
6. When your done, just pack it up in any backpack you have!

## What I Learned
- Designing **load-bearing 3D-printed parts**
- Accounting for real-world tolerances (I learned this through my brainstorming and potential designs)
- Balancing costs with strength and adjustablity
- Documenting my full project clearly and percisely

---

## Future Improvements
- Increase corner wall thickness for higher impact resistance
- Add optional ground anchors
- Add an additional pole on the bottom that can connect the small poles to the big ones
- Test alternative materials for improved durability

## Why This Project Deserves a Grant (pls)
Goated Goal is:
- An original, fully custom **hardware project**
- Designed to solve a real-world problem
- Built with engineered components, not just assembly
- Clearly documented with CAD, BOM, and design reasoning

The grant will be used to purchase materials, assemble my final version, and check the design through real-world testing (The part that I will enjoy).
