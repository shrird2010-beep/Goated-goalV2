# 🐐 Shrihan's Goated-Goal — An Adjustable Training Soccer Goal that can be used whenever!

## Overview
**Goated Goal** is a fully adjustable soccer training goal designed for individual and team practices. The goal expands up to **10 ft wide and 7 ft tall**, making it significantly bigger and more versatile than most affordable consumer goals. Unlike fixed-sized and overpriced alternatives, Goated Goal can be **changed to different widths** to match training needs and field space. For me, it offers a accurate size goal that I can use for game-like plays.

This project focuses on **mechanical engineering skills, CADing (if thats a word), and prototyping**. Instead of firmware or electronics, the innovation is in its **adjustable design and versitile functionality**, using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf materials. This time I have changed up my parts a little bit. I now have created several 3d printed parts that I will be using to build this.

## Problem with other real-world goals
Most affordable soccer goals are:
- Too small for a realistic shooting practice
- Fixed in size and difficult to adapt (Especially through my basement door!)
- Flimsy or overpriced for their weak build quality

As a student athlete, I wanted a **full-size training goal** that is:
- Adjustable
- Strong enough to handle hard shots
- Portable and easy to assemble
- Affordable (under $25)

My Goated Goal was designed to solve this problem using thoughtful mechanical engineering design.

## Key Features
- Adjustable width up to **12 ft**
- Custom **3D-printed structural corners and holders**
- Telescoping poles for adjustable sizing
- Impact-resistant full-size net
- Hardware-only/3d printing only so it is easy for anyone to replicate

## Engineering & Design

### 3D-Printed Corners
The most critical components of the design are the **custom corner brackets**, which connect the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal poles. This really helped me understand cading more.

Before, the right corner featured one oversized hole to fit the end of a telescoping pole. Now I have changed it to be the same as the left side. I have also made it so that it will hold 4 poles rather than 3.

The left corner was designed with precise diagonal pole measurements to prevent any collapsing. Its really just the same as the right side.

These are some new additions that I created after I found some old tent poles in my garage. This will cut down my costs and help me create a stronger goal. The CADS with a 3-holed bracket will be holding the top of my goal while the CAD with triangles will be the middle holder that gives structural support.

The diagonal support poles redirect impact forces from the crossbar into the vertical posts. Or in other words, if i hit the goal too hard, the structure will be A-okay.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Football Replacement Goal Net (12×6 ft) | $2.29 |
| Debonair Tent Poles Telescoping Tarp Poles| $16.90 |
| PVC Poles (10 ft) | $4.46 |
| Reusable Waterproof Electrical Cable Ties | $.78 |
| **Total** | **$24.43 (~$25)** |

All materials were selected based on availability, strength, adjustability, and cost efficiency. This took me too long to budget.

## Assembly Summary
1. Insert telescoping poles into the 3D-printed corner brackets
2. Attach diagonal support poles to prevent collapse
3. Extend poles to desired width
4. Connect the goal to the corners
5. Secure the net using the straps
6. Adjust sizing based on training needs
7. When your done, just pack it up in any backpack you have!

## What I Learned
- Designing **load-bearing 3D-printed parts**
- Accounting for real-world tolerances (I learned this through my brainstorming and potential designs)
- Balancing costs with strength and adjustablity
- Documenting my full project clearly and percisely

---

## Future Improvements
- Increase corner wall thickness for higher impact resistance
- Add optional ground anchors
- Add an additional pole on the bottom that can connect the small poles to the big ones
- Test alternative materials for improved durability

## Why This Project Deserves a Grant (pls)
Goated Goal is:
- An original, fully custom **hardware project**
- Designed to solve a real-world problem
- Built with engineered components, not just assembly
- Clearly documented with CAD, BOM, and design reasoning

The grant will be used to purchase materials, assemble my final version, and check the design through real-world testing (The part that I will enjoy).
