# 🐐 Shrihan's Goated-Goal — An Adjustable Training Soccer Goal that can be used whenever!
Inspo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOJQuOstX0s

## Overview
**Goated Goal** is a fully adjustable soccer training goal designed for individual and team practices. The goal expands up to **12 ft wide and 6 ft tall**, making it significantly bigger and more versatile than most affordable consumer goals. Unlike fixed-sized and overpriced alternatives, Goated Goal can be **changed to different widths** to match training needs and field space. For me, it offers a accurate size goal that I can use for game-like plays.

This project focuses on **mechanical engineering skills, CADing (if thats a word), and prototyping**. Instead of firmware or electronics, the innovation is in its **adjustable design and versitile functionality**, using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf materials. This time I have changed up my parts a little bit. I now have created several 3d printed parts that I will be using to build this.

## Problem with other real-world goals
Most affordable soccer goals are:
- Too small for a realistic shooting practice
- Fixed in size and difficult to adapt (Especially through my basement door!)
- Flimsy or overpriced for their weak build quality

As a student athlete, I wanted a **full-size training goal** that is:
- Adjustable
- Strong enough to handle hard shots
- Portable and easy to assemble
- Affordable (under $25)

My Goated Goal was designed to solve this problem using thoughtful mechanical engineering design.

## Key Features
- Adjustable width up to **12 ft**
- Custom **3D-printed structural corners and holders**
- Telescoping poles for adjustable sizing
- Impact-resistant full-size net
- Hardware-only/3d printing only so it is easy for anyone to replicate

## Engineering & Design

### 3D-Printed Corners
The most critical components of the design are the **custom corner brackets**, which connect the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal poles. This really helped me understand cading more.

| CAD Model |

Before, the right corner featured one oversized hole to fit the end of a telescoping pole. Now I have changed it to be the same as the left side. I have also made it so that it will hold 4 poles rather than 3.

| Before (Left pole)|

| After (Left pole)|
|-----------|

The left corner was designed with precise diagonal pole measurements to prevent any collapsing. Its really just the same as the right side. A major difference though is that I wanted the corner to be in the air before. I soon learned that wouldn't be the best option. I then later changed my idea to something more stronger.

These are some new additions that I created after I found some old tent poles in my garage. This will cut down my costs and help me create a stronger goal. The CADs with a 3-holed bracket will be holding the top of my goal while the CAD with triangles will be the middle holder that gives structural support.

## Predicted Model
Here is my final predicted model. I will be using weights to hold down the goal if it tries to move. To see the "final assembly", check the tab above. ( I also added the CADs for the bars I used. Those dont matter though because I am buying some of them and have the rest)

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Football Replacement Goal Net (12×6 ft) (price changed from $2.29) | $3.04 |
| Debonair Tent Poles Telescoping Tarp Poles| $16.90 |
| PVC Poles (10 ft) | $4.46 |
| Reusable Waterproof Electrical Cable Ties (I'll pay for this, it was $.93)| $0 |
| **Total** | **$24.40 (~$25)** |

All materials were selected based on availability, strength, adjustability, and cost efficiency. This took me too long to budget.

## What I Learned
- Designing **load-bearing 3D-printed parts**
- Accounting for real-world tolerances (I learned this through my brainstorming and potential designs)
- Balancing costs with strength and adjustablity
- Documenting my full project clearly and percisely

---

## Future Improvements
- Increase corner wall thickness for higher impact resistance
- Add optional ground anchors
- Add an additional pole in the middle that can connect the two horizontal poles together
- Test alternative materials for improved durability

---

## Why This Project Deserves a Grant (pls)
Goated Goal is:
- An original, fully custom **hardware project**
- Designed to solve a real-world problem
- Built with engineered components, not just assembly
- Clearly documented with CAD, BOM, and design reasoning

The grant will be used to purchase materials, assemble my final version, and check the design through real-world testing (The part that I will enjoy).
